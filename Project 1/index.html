            <h2> Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

            <ul>
                <li>
                      The NDA’s first full five-year term in office was marked by instability. </li>
                    <li>Regional parties came and went from the coalition as a result of local political calculations, which changed depending on the conduct of both the national government as a whole and other BJP-led state and local governments.
                    <li>Domestically, the NDA’s term in office was marked by increased liberalization of the economy.</li>
                    <li>Internationally, the BJP-led government worked to improve relations with the United States and Israel as well as to resolve conflict with Pakistan over Kashmir.</li> 
                    <li>However, although economic developments in particular were popular, the reputation of the BJP itself suffered in the 2004 elections as a result of widespread communal riots that engulfed Gujarat in 2002.</li>
                    <li>Criticism arose against some BJP members—including Modi, who was chief minister of the state of Gujarat at the time—for their role in the riots.</li>
                    <li>In 2004 the NDA lost its majority, and the Congress Party’s United Progressive Alliance (UPA) took power.</li></p>
